# Why Not Canvas?

I have used Canvas since it was a tiny blip on the LMS landscape. I have used LMS-es going back to before they were called LMS-es. And I'm tired of them. 

More seriously, the reasons for a public facing course website for public facing and non-private content is not simply to be a retro throwback to the 1990s (though that is part of the appeal). Rather, in no particular order, the reasons for building a class website with plaintext files and minimal flash is as follows:
1. Faster, cheaper, easier: I have tracked the time I spend clicking away at Canvas menus (and before that Blackboard menus ((and before that menus for whatever homegrown system Stanford had)))... and it is not pretty. Write, add/push/commit, done. 
2. Canvas (at least here) always fails during the first week. So why hide all that content where I have no control over whether students can see it or not? 
3. Every few years material gets purged from our local LMS. That's not cool. I would prefer to have control over my own stuff.
4. Check out Ethical Ed Tech and recent conversations about Canvas' non-policy towards privacy. 
5. Keyboards are awesome. 
6. Mice are annoying. Did I mention the clicking?
