<h3 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h3>
<p>This course looks at the big questions of what it means to be human through materials ranging from the paleolithic through modernity. The course includes regular assignments that require students to read, write, and interpret the materials of the past, including but not limited to literature, art, music, performance, and ideas.</p>
<p>This course has been approved for the Liberal Studies For the 21st Century Competencies requirements, and thus is designed to help you &ldquo;become a thoughtful patron of and participant in Humanities and Cultural Practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As this is a course with a lot of moving parts, I have included a fair amount of explanation in this syllabus so that everyone can have this material as reference. <em>As you review this document and the course website site, please remember at all times: if you have a question or concern, get in touch asap.</em> Tell me what is going on and we'll proceed from there.</p>
<h3 id="teaching-assistants">Teaching Assistants</h3>

<h3 id="course-materials">Course Materials</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All required readings and materials will be available in some form online, either in the class repository, through the FSU Library, or through a publicly-accessible archive or resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the OneBook assignment students are required to purchase or obtain through the library the full version of something that we read or explore only in part as part of the class (see further instructions.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You must purchase a single set of 3x5 index cards, white, lined. (i.e. the most standard and common type of index card there is). We will use these starting in the second week of class. You will need at least one for every class session for the remainder of the term.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Sayre textbook is NOT required for this class and should not be purchased.</p>
<p>You are highly encouraged, but not required, to purchase any of the primary texts (e.g. <em>Iliad</em>, Dante's <em>Inferno</em>, etc.) for each week. Research has consistently shown that reading texts on paper allows for better understanding and retention of material.  I have provided a link to a good print translation or edition of each primary text with the  individual reading assignments.</p>
<p>[Note re: third party materials. I don't know what  materials are out there regarding this class (e.g. study guides, notes,  etc.). I remake this class each time it is taught and this iteration in  particular is a major version change/upgrade; I expect that any  materials related to previous iterations will be useless or misleading  for this course. Just FYI.]</p>
<h3 id="technology-requirements">Technology Requirements</h3>
<h4 id="in-class-tech-free">In class: Tech free</h4>
<p>Our classroom is a phone and laptop-free zone. Enjoy the sweet freedom from your device.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate class activities and provide a space best  suited to our work together, students should have in class with them the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing implement(s) of your choice</li>
<li>Optional: Paper notebook or place to take notes during class. All lectures will be available via lecture capture online.</li>
<li>Optional: physical copy or print out of any readings if desired.</li>
</ul>
<p>All other items can remain stowed until the end of the class session.</p>
<p>[Note: If you have an SDRC letter or other issue related to use of  computers or technology in class, test-taking and the like, then please  speak to me within the first week of the term. This is not a typical  lecture class insofar as I will not usually be speaking for an hour each class while you all dutifully take notes. There are a number of systems in place in this class for the most common issues that come up through  the SDRC. We can speak individually about these and make sure to address any specific issues. All of these systems are there to help you get as  much as possible out of our limited time together in class.]</p>
<h4 id="sidebar-devices-in-the-classroom">Sidebar: Devices in the Classroom</h4>
<p>Studies of device use in the classroom have shown consistently that students on phones and laptops who are looking at material not related to class perform at least one half letter grade below their peers. Moreover, everyone within a 6 foot radius around that person performs worse than they would have if they were sitting elsewhere. There is copious research that people retain information better by writing it down vs. typing into a computer. This has to do both with the tactile nature of writing and with the spatial physicality of words on a page. It is also a function of having to think and process information in order to write it down rather than (for most people who can type faster than they can write) quoting nearly verbatim what is said. Processing means memory; stenography is in one ear out the other.</p>
<h4 id="outside-of-class-technology-requirements">Outside of Class: Technology requirements</h4>
<p>Much of this is fairly obvious, but is made explicit here in case there are any questions.</p>
<p><strong>Headline: Keep Backups of your work!!!</strong></p>
<p>Course content is accessible online. The course site and all technologies used in this class are designed to be minimal so as to work with the maximum number of devices/hardware/platforms. All you should need is a web browser.</p>
<p>The following are specific technology requirements for this course. Note that some of these are fairly obvious, but are included for the sake of completeness. These are all the responsibility of individual students. Computers in the library are also available with all of the functionality described below.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Reliable internet connection, access to all resources: It is assumed that all students have a working FSU ID, access to FSU Libraries, and a reliable internet connection. Students must have access to a functioning laptop or desktop computer. It is highly recommended that you update all drivers and software.
1b. Library Resources: If you are working from off campus, note that subscription sites can always be accessed through the library proxy server. Just add .proxy.lib.fsu.edu after the web address. For example, if you are trying to reach oxfordreference.com, simply make it <a href="http://www.oxfordreference.com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu">http://www.oxfordreference.com.proxy.lib.fsu.edu</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to create documents. The only accepted file types for most written work are .doc, .docx, .txt, .md, .adoc. That is, plaintext files and Word documents are fine. (In some cases .pdf may be appropriate, though this is rare). Powerpoint and .pages files will not be accepted for any assignments. Keep a local copy of any assignment you submit. It is  good practice, in general, to have a backup of any work on your computer. For this class, it can be as simple as a usb thumb drive with a folder for this classes files. It is also worth having an extra copy in case there is ever any question about whether or not you completed the work. The original document preserves vital information that is sometimes erased upon upload. HAVE A BACKUP.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Problems? If there are any questions or significant difficulties with any of these requirements, then get in touch with me immediately.</p>
<p>Bang for your buck in computing: And, finally, on computer hardware. For those using older equipment or in cases where computer costs are a real impediment to work, I strongly advocate the use of free (as in “libre” software). For under $200 you can grab a perfectly good older computer in decent condition and install one of many flavors of Linux and have a fast and full-featured computer suitable for this course (and for most general work). This is also a good  option if you are working on an older machine that has significantly slowed down. If you would like guidance in this regard then just drop me a line. For those on campus, computers in the library and in any campus computer labs will have the required software and hardware for this course.</p>
<h3 id="first-day-attendance">First Day Attendance</h3>
<p>It is university policy that all students not &ldquo;in&rdquo; class on the first day of the term be listed as absent and dropped from the class. This is done so as to make sure that all students who want (and need) seats in the class have a chance to enroll.</p>
<p><em>HOWEVER, please note that it is in all cases a student's responsibility to handle his or her own class enrollments. If you are planning on dropping the course for any reason, DO NOT assume that you will be dropped automatically or immediately by the instructor. Students are solely responsible for their enrollment or non-enrollment in this course.</em></p>
<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>
<p>Class assignments are meant to be straightforward:</p>
<p><em>Daily</em>: Read/View stuff before class each day; complete a brief write-up and submit before class; complete a brief (5 minute) quiz/attendance check at the beginning of class and come to class prepared to deepen your understanding and participate fully in activities; repeat x45.</p>
<p><em>Weekly</em>: 1-2 page response from a menu of choices, on all the material of the week, submitted online before the start of class the next week.</p>
<p><em>A project to deepen your knowledge of a primary text</em> of interest to you from the class: OneBook assignment, due at the end of the term (Monday April 28)</p>
<p><em>A final project</em> to weave together your previous writings (a &ldquo;Research Paper&rdquo;) 8-12 pages, due at the end of the term (Monday April 28)</p>
<p><em>A midterm</em>: just the facts, where you've seen most of the questions already (Thursday 2/27)</p>
<p><em>A &ldquo;final&rdquo;</em>: like the midterm, but covering the whole semester, in the next to last week of class (Thursday 4/16)</p>
<h3 id="submission-naming">Submission Naming</h3>
<p>For any assignment submitted online, it must be named as follows:</p>
<p>[lastname]_[firstname]+[assignmentnumber]</p>
<p>So, for example, for a student named Luke Skywalker, completing an assignment that is labeled 1ad, the file submitted should be called skywalker_luke+1ad.docx or skywalker_luke+1ad.md or something similar (depending on the file extension). No spaces, all lowercase. This helps me to automate various functions with your work.</p>
<h3 id="grading">Grading</h3>
<p>Grading is divided over the term into units of three weeks at a time; the midterm, final, and projects are added in at the end. <strong>So, in general, your grade is made up by weighting each of the grades in the following categories equally to make up a final grade.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Weeks1-3, Weeks4-6, Weeks7-9, Weeks 10-13, Weeks14-16, Midterm/Final, Onebook/FinalProject</strong></p>
<p>The grades for <em>Midterm and Final</em> are simple percentages converted to letter grades (see scale below). Grades for the <em>two projects</em> are given as a simple letter grade based on meeting the standards specified for the assignment: exceeds standards (A), meets standards (B+), below standards and needs improvement (C+), unacceptable (F)</p>
<p><strong>For daily and weekly assignments, grade is calculated based on the following:</strong></p>
<p><em>Before class, submitted online</em>: 6 out of 6 is an A, 5 out of 6 is a B+, 4 out of 6 is a C+, 3 or less is an F (doing half the work is not passing the class)</p>
<p><em>Beginning of class, &ldquo;quiz&rdquo;/attendance:</em> any score counts as attendance (C+), greater than 70% correct counts as satisfactory (B+), greater than 90% counts as an A.</p>
<p><em>During class</em>: this is what the index cards are for. 6 out of 6 is an A, 5 out of 6 is a B+, 4 out of 6 is a C+, 3 or less is an F (i.e. showing up to class half the time is not passing the class)</p>
<p><em>Weekly, submitted online</em>: 3 out of 3 is an A, 2 out of 3 is a C+, 1 out of 3 or less is an F (again, doing 1/3 of the work is not a passing grade)</p>
<p><em>Quality Bonus</em>: At the end of each 3-week period, any high work of particularly high quality gets a bonus which can be applied here or in future weeks to the lowest of any of these individual grades, converting it automagically to an A.</p>

<h3 id="late-assignments">Late Assignments</h3>
<p>No credit is given for late assignments. There is no partial credit.  There are no extensions. As the vast majority of assignments are frequent and low stakes, any individual assignment missed here or there should have no impact on the final grade. Built into the system is room for the occasional  illness or absence as occurs during the term. Note, however, that  missing assignments, particularly early in the semester, will severely  limit your flexibility later in the term.</p>
<p>Flexibility has been designed into the grading system and so there is no need, in general, to explain absences or seek redress for absences.  As all materials from in-class will be made available online, there is  also no need to ask for what you missed, as it will be available for  review.</p>
<p>However, in cases of <strong>significant or chronic</strong> absence, you should get in touch with me so that we can address the issue.</p>
<h3 id="schedule">Schedule</h3>
<p>The schedule of assignments is maintained online. The general breakdown for topics and weeks is as follows:</p>
<p>Weeks 1-3 (1/7-1/23): Introduction, Methods, Antiquity to Modernity</p>
<p>Weeks 4-6 (1/28 - 2/13): Not Gods: Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece</p>
<p>Weeks 7-9 (2/18 - 3/5): Not Animals: Greek Tragedy, Dante, Enlightenment [midterm in week 8,</p>
<p>Thursday 2/27]</p>
<p>Weeks 10-13 (3/10 - 4/2): Makers and Creators [note Spring Break, 3/17 and 3/19]</p>
<p>Weeks 14-16 (4/7 - 4/24): On Ignorance [&ldquo;Final&rdquo; in week 15, Thursday 4/16]</p>
<h3 id="privacy-and-non-reuse">Privacy and Non-reuse</h3>
<p>We live in a heavily digital world and one where best practices about use and re-use are often murky. Therefore, the following guidelines are intended to clarify expectations reciprocally, both for how I will  handle your materials and how you should handle class materials.</p>
<p>Student-created content will not be reproduced or copied outside of  its use by me and by the TAs for this course and will not be shared by the instructor without the express written consent of the student. Materials will be retained for one year and then archived.</p>
<p>All course content is the intellectual property of the instructor.  Videos and course materials are not to be reproduced, shared, or  published without the express written consent of the instructor. This  includes sharing of any course content anonymously and on any platform.  Failure to abide by this guideline will result in an &ldquo;F&rdquo; in the course.  Instructor reserves the right to impose this grade retroactively after  the course has ended should such instances come to light only at a later date.</p>
<p>You can of course share, sell, or otherwise distribute your notes or  material you yourself have created in whatever manner you like.</p>
<h3 id="university-policies">University Policies</h3>
<h4 id="university-attendance-policy">University Attendance Policy</h4>
<p>Excused absences include documented illness, deaths in the family and other documented crises, call to active military duty or jury duty, religious holy days, and official University activities. These absences will be accommodated in a way that does not arbitrarily penalize students who have a valid excuse. Consideration will also be given to students whose dependent children experience serious illness.</p>
<h4 id="academic-honor-policy">Academic Honor Policy</h4>
<p>The Florida State University Academic Honor Policy outlines the University's expectations for the integrity of students&rsquo; academic work, the procedures for resolving alleged violations of those expectations, and the rights and responsibilities of students and faculty members throughout the process. Students are responsible for reading the Academic Honor Policy and for living up to their pledge to &ldquo;&hellip;be honest and truthful and&hellip; [to] strive for personal and institutional integrity at Florida State University.&rdquo; (For more details see the FSU Academic Honor Policy and procedures for addressing alleged violations (Links to an external site.).)</p>
<h4 id="americans-with-disabilities-act">Americans With Disabilities Act</h4>
<p>Students with disabilities needing academic accommodation should (1) register with and provide documentation to the Student Disability Resource Center and (2) bring a letter to the instructor indicating the need for accommodation and what type. Please note that instructors are not allowed to provide classroom accommodation to a student until appropriate verification from the Student Disability Resource Center has been provided. This syllabus and other class materials are available in alternative format upon request. For more information about services available to FSU students with disabilities, contact the:</p>
