# Schedule

The schedule is maintained here as a folder of individual assignments. Each day has a title by week and day such that, for example, the Tuesday of the first week is "1a", the Thursday of the first week is "1b", and then the Tuesday of the second week is "2a" and so forth.

Assignments are due before class begins for the day listed on each assignment. 

If there are broken links, please report them immediately to me.
