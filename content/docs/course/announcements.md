# Announcements

Welcome to Hum 2020, Spring 2020. For this first week our main goal is to get all our systems in place and get a conversation started about the big ideas of the course. Regular assignments will start up next week. The first assignments (listed under assignments, for 1b, that is, the second class of the first week) are to first, review the syllabus and, second, send me a brief email message with a bit about yourself. 

In class on Thursday we will go over the regular workflow for the course and walk through together all the steps of going through an assignment. 

Over the next few days content will be added rapidly to this site and additional menu items will appear as needed. Don't be alarmed. 

In the meantime, welcome back to campus.
