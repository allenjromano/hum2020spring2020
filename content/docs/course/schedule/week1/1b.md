# 1b: Thursday, January 9

The first assignment is simple and should be straightforward:

1. Review the syllabus. If you have any questions, please ask via email or be prepared to ask during class on Thursday

2. Send me an email, in advance of class on Thursday, with a brief introduction. What do you want me to know about you? What are you interested in? What do you want to hear about?
