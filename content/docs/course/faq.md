# Frequently Asked Questions, aka "What should I do if...."

## General advice
If you have a question about anything, you should, in general, do the following:

 1. Check the course homepage. See if there are relevant announcements, tips, or anything in the ticker.
2. Check the syllabus.
3. Check the specific assignment. There's a lot of verbiage there. Often your answer is waiting there.

If none of these methods resolves your problem, then get in touch with me via the methods laid out on the homepage.

And, as a general rule, the answer is always, **don't panic** and then come and talk to me about it if necessary.
